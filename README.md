When I'm not buried in code, you'll find me leading teams, designing interfaces, or figuring out how to make technology more human. I believe the best software doesn't just run, it's fun. ✨ I love building stuff that people actually want to use, whether that's streamlining business processes or creating delightful user experiences. I'm fascinated by how good design and solid engineering can transform everyday interactions, and I'm currently exploring how AI can enhance (not replace) human creativity. Always down to learn something new or collaborate on interesting projects! 🚀
